Tutorial: Interfacing NEST and OpenAI Gym
=========================================

Preparations
------------

You first need to install a variety of tools:

1. Download and install MUSIC from <https://github.com/incf-music>
2. Download and install MUSIC adapters from <https://github.com/incf-music/music-adapters>
3. Download and install NEST from <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator>
   Do not forget to set `-Dwith-music=ON`
4. Install OpenAI Gym via pip (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gym>)
5. Install gymz via pip (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gymz>)

[IDEA: build everything up from scratch, only introduce one new script at a time]
[postpone installation of the required components as far as possible to minimize frustration and create a TLDR for the impatient]
[lighten the style, this is currently a huge wall of text]

[before you start, please make sure to have all paths set correctly (see add_paths.sh)]

Example 0: Python to Python via ZeroMQ
--------------------------------------

Preparations:

- install PyZMQ via pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzmq>
- clone this repository and navigate to example0/

We start by sending data from one Python process to another via ZeroMQ sockets <http://zeromq.org/>, see <https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html> for the PyZMQ documentation.

We use a specific message format based on JSON to communicate between processes.
All messages are list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing an observed value, the limits of this value and a timestamp.
The limits are necessary to normalize the data in subsequent MUSIC adapters and the timestamp is used to detect desynchronization between different parts of the toolchain.
The length of the list depends on the number of independent channels we need.
A simple message with one channel, would hence look similar to the following:

.. code:: javascript

          [{'min': -2, 'max': 1, 'value': 0.1, 'ts': 1508443240.706507}]

To communicate between processes asynchronously, we use a publisher/subscriber model.
In this example, we set up a publisher (``zmq.PUB``) that continuously sends out a sine wave for ``t_max`` seconds with a time step between two messages of ``dt`` (see ``sender.py``).
The receiver registers as a subscriber (``zmq.SUBSCRIBE``) to the publisher (see ``zmq_receiver.py``).

You can run this example by starting the sender in one terminal and the receiver in another. Both scripts should print messages to the screen continuously.

.. code:: bash

          $ ./zmq_sender.py
          $ ./zmq_receiver.py


Example 1: Python to Python via ZeroMQ & MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------

We now include a MUSIC adapter in the loop.
We will use the Python scripts from the previous example to send and receive data, but rectify the sine wave using a threshold adapter.
The MUSIC setup is defined in a config file (see example1/config.music), in which we specifiy the various binaries and how MUSIC channels are connected to each other.
For details on this configuration file, see the MUSIC docs at <http://insert-link-to-music-doc>.
For documentation for the various adapters see <http://insert-link-to-music-adapters-doc>.

To convert messages from the ZeroMQ domain to MUSIC-compatible data, we use a ``zmq_cont_adapter`` (read "ZeroMQ->Continuous value adapter").
This adapter can read messages in the format defined above, and converts them to to continuous values communicated via MUSIC.
This data is then send to a ``threshold_adapter`` which can be configured to replace all negative values with zero.
To transform this continuous data from MUSIC back to our message format, we use a ``cont_zmq_adapter``.

Note that since the ``cont_zmq_adapter`` sends data via port 5557, we need to specify this port also in ``zmq_receiver.py``.
If this would still be set to 5556, it would directly receive data from ```zmq_sender.py``.

Tou can run the example by starting the sender and receiver, and running MUSIC with the corresponding config file and  an appropiate number of processes.
You should see a similar output as in the first example, but now all negative values are set to zero due to the threshold adapter.

.. code:: bash

          $ ./zmq_sender.py
          $ ./zmq_receiver.py
          $ mpirun -np 3 music config.music


Example 2: Python to NEST via ZeroMQ & MUSIC
-------------------------------------------

as first step, we feed custom input from a Python script via ZeroMQ into a neuron in NEST

we start with a simple Python script that sends a sine wave via a ZeroMQ socket (see zmq_sender.py)
note that the message needs to have a certain format (see [link to adapter doc])

this data needs to be received by a MUSIC adapter and converted into spikes before it can be used in NEST
for this we use the zmq_cont_adapter that receives data in the format specified above and scales the value to the range [-1, 1] (see music_setup.music)
to convert this continuos value into spikes, we connect the output of the zmq_cont_adapter to an encoder
this receives continous data and produces regular spike trains. to determine the rate of the spiketrain, one can define a minimal and a maximal rate
the value received (expected to be between [-1, 1]) is then converted to an appropiate rate
this spiketrain can now be fed into a neuron in NEST

in nest, we create a music proxy, that receives spikes (music_event_in_proxy), since it should receive data, we need to specify the port name "in"
we then can directly connect this proxy to a neuron; in our setup we use two neurons to record the spiketrain and the free membrane potential at the same time

to run this example, you first start zmq_sender.py and then launch music with mpirun and the appropiate number of processes:

.. code:: bash

          $ ./zmq_sender.py
          $ mpirun -np 3 music config.music


Example 3: OpenAI Gym to NEST via ZeroMQ & MUSIC
------------------------------------------------

now create a simple setup in which we use the toolchain to feed observations from an environment from OpenAI Gym into a simulation with two neurons that mimic place cells
we use the MountainCar environment and the neurons respond to to the agent being in the left half, and the right half of the screen, respectively


Example 4: OpenAI Gym to NEST and back via ZeroMQ & MUSIC
---------------------------------------------------------


TODO (what I realized is missing during writing this)
=====================================================
- explain every entry in default config
- documentation for all adapters/encoders
- explain message types
- MUSIC is not very user friendly in terms of error messages, we should help to improve this
